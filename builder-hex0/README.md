# Builder-Hex0 v0.1-prerelease
Builder-Hex0 is a builder with a hex0 compiler. It runs in the form of a bootable disk image.

It has these features:
* Minimal 32-bit mode POSIX kernel
* The kernel is less than 3K in size
* Built-in Minimal Shell
* Built-in `src` command to load source files
* Built-in `hex0` Compiler converts hex source to binary files
* Written in 2K lines of commented hex

## Status
* Development goals have been reached.
  * It can build itself
  * It can build stage0-posix
* Minimal support available
* For Experienced developers

## Why?

This kernel is for bootstrapping compilers without having to trust a prebuilt binary. You still have to trust that the hex codes proovided represent the x86 opcodes in the comments. But verifying the opcodes have been encoded properly is a straightforward process that you are encouraged to do using your own methods. You can also convert the hex to binary by any method you prefer. A Makefile is provided to do all this for you, for convenience, but you are free to distrust that in favor of your own methods.

## Quick Start

This command verifies the builder can build itself correctly:
```
make test
```

The self check converts the hex to a binary boot image, appends a self-build script to the image, boots the image to run the build, and afterwards verifies the result.

### Detailed Build Instructions
1. Convert builder-hex0.hex0 to binary using a method you trust
2. Append zero bytes to the image in multiples of 512 bytes (sectors)
3. Write the shell script for your build directly on partition 4 of the disk image
    * Partition 4 starts at sector 8 which is byte offset 3584 of the disk
    * The script must be zero terminated, so the maximum length is the image size minus 3585 bytes
    * See self-test.sh for guidance
4. Launch the PC with the disk image
5. Wait until the machine reboots
6. The disk image itself is the result of the build


You can use the Makefile to build an image (builder-hex0.img) ready for your source code:

```
make
```

FYI, this is the main command that creates the boot sectors:
```
cut builder-hex0.hex0 -f1 -d'#' | cut -f1 -d';' | xxd -r -p > builder-hex0.bin
```
* cut strips comments starting with pound or semicolon.
* xxd converts hex to binary.

## Machine Requirements
* x86 32-bit Processor
* PC compatible-BIOS
   * Must support int 10h,AH=0Eh (Write character to console)
   * Must support int 13h,AH=02h (Read Sectors)
   * Must support int 13h,AH=03h (Write Sectors)
   * Must support int 13h,AH=08h (Read Drive Parameters)
   * Must support int 15h,0x2401 (A20 activation)


## The Builder Shell
The builder shell is the first "process" to start although it is really just a function embedded in the kernel.

This internal shell reads commands from standard input.
The kernel provides this input by reading the contents of the fourth disk partition.

Essentially, the kernel starts by executing the equivalent of this command:
```
cat /dev/hda4 | internalshell
```

The internal shell supports two build-in commands:
* src: create source file from stdin.
* hex0: compile hex0 file to binary file.

The internal shell will also execute any file that has previously been written (by hex0). Note that the internal shell only supports parsing exactly one argument that it will pass to the command. (This is enough to support executing a new shell and passing it the name of a shell script to run.)


### The src command

```
src $number_of_lines $filename 
```
Read N lines from standard input and write to a file.

Example:
```
src 4 foo.hex0
45 23 23
23 45
53 55
53 55
```

### The hex0 command

The hex0 command implements a compiler for the Hex0 language. 
The hex0 language is described later in this document.

```
hex0 $input_hex0_file $output_binary_file
```

Reads hex0 from the input file, converts to binary, and writes to the output file.


## The Hex0 Builder System Interface

System calls are implemented with a POSIX i386 ABI interface.
System calls are accessed via interrupt 0x80.

The following system calls are implemented to some extent:
* exit
* fork
* read
* write
* open
* waitpid
* execve
* chmod
* lseek
* brk
* chdir
